# Project4 MDV Update:

Completed:
•	B-scan mode fully functional. 
•	Can sweep through different cross sections of OCT dataset
•	Can switch axes to view cross sections in a different plane
•	Can switch between B-scan mode and volume mode

To be completed:
•	Implement image tracking to activate and deactivate the OCT viewer
•	Add volume rendering to view in Volume mode

Anticipated changes to project scope:
•	En face OCT projections have very few features for the Vuforia Engine to track, so image-based activation and deactivation of the OCT viewer will require a different tracker, potentially a 2D diagram of the eye and eye anatomy.
